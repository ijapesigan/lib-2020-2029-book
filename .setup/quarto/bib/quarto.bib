  abstract = {Lauded for its easy-to-understand, conversational discussion of the fundamentals of mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis, this book has been fully revised with 50\% new content, including sections on working with multicategorical antecedent variables, the use of PROCESS version 3 for SPSS and SAS for model estimation, and annotated PROCESS v3 outputs. Using the principles of ordinary least squares regression, Andrew F. Hayes carefully explains procedures for testing hypotheses about the conditions under and the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, as well as the moderation of such mechanisms. Hayes shows how to estimate and interpret direct, indirect, and conditional effects; probe and visualize interactions; test questions about moderated mediation; and report different types of analyses. Data for all the examples are available on the companion website (www.afhayes.com) along with links to download PROCESS.},

  abstract = {Computational models of affect dynamics are ubiquitous. These models are appropriate for either exploring intensive longitudinal data or testing theories about affect dynamics. In this chapter, we give a brief overview of some of the computational models that have been applied in the field of affect dynamics, focusing on both discrete-time and continuous-time models. The emphasis of this chapter lies on describing the core ideas of the models and how they can be interpreted. At the end, we provide references to other important topics for the interested reader.},
