  abstract = {This book focuses on a span of statistical topics relevant to researchers who seek to conduct person-specific analysis of human data. Our purpose is to provide one consolidated resource that includes techniques from disciplines such as engineering, physics, statistics, and quantitative psychology and outlines their application to data often seen in human research. The book balances mathematical concepts with information needed for using these statistical approaches in applied settings, such as interpretative caveats and issues to consider when selecting an approach.
The statistical topics covered here include foundational material as well as state-of-the-art methods. These analytic approaches can be applied to a range of data types such as psychophysiological, self-report, and passively collected measures such as those obtained from smartphones. We provide examples using varied data sources including functional MRI (fMRI), daily diary, and ecological momentary assessment data.
Features:
Description of time series, measurement, model building, and network methods for person-specific analysis
Discussion of the statistical methods in the context of human research
Empirical and simulated data examples used throughout the book
R code for analyses and recorded lectures for each chapter available at the book website: https://www.personspecific.com/
Across various disciplines of human study, researchers are increasingly seeking to conduct person-specific analysis. This book provides comprehensive information, so no prior knowledge of these methods is required. We aim to reach active researchers who already have some understanding of basic statistical testing. Our book provides a comprehensive resource for those who are just beginning to learn about person-specific analysis as well as those who already conduct such analysis but seek to further deepen their knowledge and learn new tools.

  abstract = {Lauded for its easy-to-understand, conversational discussion of the fundamentals of mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis, this book has been fully revised with 50\% new content, including sections on working with multicategorical antecedent variables, the use of PROCESS version 3 for SPSS and SAS for model estimation, and annotated PROCESS v3 outputs. Using the principles of ordinary least squares regression, Andrew F. Hayes carefully explains procedures for testing hypotheses about the conditions under and the mechanisms by which causal effects operate, as well as the moderation of such mechanisms. Hayes shows how to estimate and interpret direct, indirect, and conditional effects; probe and visualize interactions; test questions about moderated mediation; and report different types of analyses. Data for all the examples are available on the companion website (www.afhayes.com) along with links to download PROCESS.},

  abstract = {Computational models of affect dynamics are ubiquitous. These models are appropriate for either exploring intensive longitudinal data or testing theories about affect dynamics. In this chapter, we give a brief overview of some of the computational models that have been applied in the field of affect dynamics, focusing on both discrete-time and continuous-time models. The emphasis of this chapter lies on describing the core ideas of the models and how they can be interpreted. At the end, we provide references to other important topics for the interested reader.},
