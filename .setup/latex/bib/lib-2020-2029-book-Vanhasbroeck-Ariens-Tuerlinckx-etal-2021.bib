  abstract  = {Computational models of affect dynamics are ubiquitous. These models are appropriate for either exploring intensive longitudinal data or testing theories about affect dynamics. In this chapter, we give a brief overview of some of the computational models that have been applied in the field of affect dynamics, focusing on both discrete-time and continuous-time models. The emphasis of this chapter lies on describing the core ideas of the models and how they can be interpreted. At the end, we provide references to other important topics for the interested reader.},
